[Online lessons](https://stapletonsl.github.io/data-wrangle-intro/)


### Advanced OpenRefine
[Online lessons] (coming soon....)

These lessons teach advanced data wrangling skills including combining datasets, geolocating data, and “what if” exploration using OpenRefine. You will learn methods to:
- extend a dataset with an additional variable
- concatenate (join up) variables
- revisit tidy data using GREL
- create an interactive map from a dataset using Geo.json.io tool
- share the map via Github

This workshop is aimed at researchers and HDRs working with structured or semi-structured data.  

### Visualisation basics for HASS researchers
[Online lessons] (coming soon...)

Visualising data can help us understand complex information quickly.   Transforming data into a visual format can:
- reveal patterns and relationships
- identify trends and
- communicate insights with impact

Explore methods and tools to create publication quality visualisations of complex, structured data from spreadsheets.
