### Data Wrangling with OpenRefine for Humanities and Social Sciences
[Online lessons](https://github.com/GriffithUniLibrary/data-wrangling-intro/blob/master/data-wrangling-intro-for-hass-1.md)

In these lessons we use Open Refine, an open source tool to scrutinize, clean, organise, combine and transform data.  It is particularly powerful when working with large datasets. The tool automatically tracks changes made to the data, producing a script to enable reproducibility and documentation to provide verification.  Many people comment that this tool saves them months of work trying to edit and clean by hand. 
Learn these data wrangling skills at the beginning of data collection:
- explore tabular data through facets and filters
- implement ['tidy data principles'](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)
- clean, organise and prepare data for analysis
- use basic features of OpenRefine
- extract and reuse a reproducible script to repeat processing on similar data

### Advanced OpenRefine
[Online lessons] (coming soon....)
These lessons teach advanced data wrangling skills including combining datasets, geolocating data, and “what if” exploration using OpenRefine. You will learn methods to:
-extend a dataset with an additional variable
-concatenate (join up) variables
-revisit tidy data using GREL
-create an interactive map from a dataset using Geo.json.io tool
-share the map via Github

This workshop is aimed at researchers and HDRs working with structured or semi-structured data.
